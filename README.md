## How It's Made:


**Tech used:** Node js and Express Js and a dash of HTML

The main tech that i used here was express js. I used this beacuse it is a Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js It has a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy. I also used postman to test if the API would return the data that I want.

## Optimizations
I will improve this by increasing the data that the API can receive. I will also incoporate MONGO DB to store my data and also have a way users can add data if they dont find what they need.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned about Express JS and building an API from scratch. 
It is important to start building an API with the end user in mind.
